There are only three files in this project. Fist, .htaccess, is for running php, so if it wasn't there, it wouldn't work. The second is the code it self, which is commented, so to find out more about it...just open it. The third one, text.txt, is just txt file, where all the contributions are stored, so you can delete some constribution there. That's all...ENJOY :)
